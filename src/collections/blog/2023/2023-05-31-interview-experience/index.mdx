## I. Introduction

   In a world where technology is evolving at an unprecedented pace, the significance of exploring new technologies cannot be overstated. As aspiring professionals, we find ourselves standing on the precipice of innovation, eager to delve into uncharted territories and seize the transformative opportunities that lie ahead. Nothing accelerates learning in a field more than gaining practical, hands-on experience. 
   The purpose of the blog post is to provide the reader a sneak peek into a LFX internship and what transitioning to a completely new tech stack is like.
   Successful completion of my tasks at Meshery during this internship required me to have deep knowledge of Go, Docker, Kubernetes, Helm and a pinch of ReactJs. 3 months ago, I couldn't say I had any of these. This is me sharing my journey of learning through hands-on experiences and adapting on the fly.

## II. Prelude to the Internship

   I wanted to participate in programs like GSoC and LFX Mentorship ever since I got to know about them. These programs focused on helping students and early-career professionals with valuable opportunities to gain practical experience, enhance their skills, and contribute to open source projects. These programs aim to bridge the gap between academic learning and real-world application by offering mentorship and guidance from experienced professionals in the industry.
   Lack of confidence, motivation and mentorship kept me from even applying. This time was a bit different as I did take the smallest possible step, I applied. I decided to dive headfirst into contributing code and engaging with the community. Little did I know that my proactive approach would lead to an incredible opportunity as an LFX intern at Meshery.
   I already had fundamental working knowledge of Go. I had built a few simple projects using it (you can check them out at my Github). I had used K8s & Helm but that was the extent of my knowledge of them. Throughout my internship I asked dumb questions (I still do), made incorrect changes (I still do), chased red herrings (I still do) and everything else that I could do wrong. Doing mistakes is part of the process and we just grow to make less no. of mistakes and make more complex ones.
   

## III. Onboarding and Orientation

   First day in the community is almost the same for most people. Joining in the newcomers meet, introducing yourself, getting to know which kind of dumb questions should be directed to whom. 
   Then there's a public Meshery meet where everyone comes together and show off what they've been working on for the past week. This meet is a great opportunity to catch up with everyone else's tasks and volunteer to help or get something of your own.
   The newcomers guide covers all this and more, go [take a look](https://layer5.io/community/newcomers).

## IV. Immersive Project Experience & Upskilling

   In the course of this internship, I got to contribute to the core elements of Meshery. My tasks included:
   - Adding a new feature to deploy & undeploy Meshery adapters in both Docker & Kubernetes environments.
   - Upgrading Meshsync to be configurable and to receive updates on the specified resources with the specified frequencies.
   - Depreciating the use of docker & compose CLIs for executing internal commands and replacing them with Docker and compose go SDKs.
   - Resolving critical bugs
   - Implementing connection state machine
   - Writing this blog

Working with unfamiliar technologies, such as advanced Kubernetes concepts, presented its challenges. However, I overcame the learning curve by utilizing online resources, documentation, and seeking guidance from experienced professionals at Meshery. Adapting to the different coding style, internal libraries and project structure in Go required flexibility and persistence. Breaking down tasks into smaller components and planning them over phases of development helped tackle complex problems effectively.

Throughout the project, I received valuable mentorship and guidance from the experienced professionals at Meshery. The collaborative environment fostered knowledge sharing, code reviews, and constructive feedback, which greatly enhanced my learning experience. The availability of mentors who provided guidance and assistance proved invaluable in navigating challenges and acquiring new skills.

This internship provided me with profound insights into Go programming and deep Kubernetes concepts. I gained a solid understanding of Go's syntax, concurrency patterns, and best practices. Furthermore, I immersed myself in the intricacies of Kubernetes architecture, honing my understanding of deployment strategies and resource management. These newfound insights allowed me to apply my knowledge effectively in real-world scenarios throughout the project.

The tangible results of my contributions were evident. I successfully added the feature to deploy and undeploy Meshery adapters in Docker and Kubernetes is under progress. Moreover, I upgraded Meshsync CRD, making it configurable and enabling updates on specified resources with specified frequencies. The deprecation of Docker and compose CLIs in favor of Docker and compose Go SDKs streamlined internal command execution. Additionally, I resolved critical bugs, improving the stability and functionality of Meshery. Couldn't complete connection state machine but I hope that I'll deliver this too in the time I'm here. Finally, writing this blog served as another contribution to the project and the Meshery community.

## V. Personal and Professional Growth:
Professionally, this internship has been transformative. I have expanded my skill set significantly, gaining proficiency in Go programming and deep Kubernetes concepts. The experience has honed my problem-solving skills, adaptability, and resilience when working with unfamiliar technologies. Moreover, I have gained insights into project management, effective collaboration, and communication within a professional setting. Overall, this internship has had a profound impact on my career aspirations and has opened doors to future opportunities.

## V. Conclusion

   Overall it was a great experience. I recommend everyone to take part in similar programs. If you are a student or an early career professional go ahead and learn new languages, new technologies, meet new people, expand your horizons. If you're a veteran then help others out through your expertise, you can never know everything and it's never too late to learn.
